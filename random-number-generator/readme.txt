This is a simple program to generate 12 digits random number generator. Result is written to a .txt file. 
The important point for doing this was I couldn't find a tool to generate more than 10 digits random number on the internet.

secondly, I faced a bit problem generating jar file using command prompt and I was facing "no main manifest attribute in jar file" error.
Finally I could generate the right Jar file through Intellij using bellow link:
